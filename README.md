For a simple portfolio/introduction website this is really really overengineered...

# Development

Thanks to the way JavaScript modules behave, you can no longer just open the index.html in your browser unless you want to get CORS errors.
Instead, either create a local Apache Server or use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

With http-server, just go into the project directory and call `http-server .`. You can now develop for my portfolio, great!
